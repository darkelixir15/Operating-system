mmap()  creates a new mapping in the virtual address space of the call‐
ing process.  The starting address for the new mapping is specified  in
addr. The  length argument specifies the length of the mapping (which
must be greater than 0).

If addr is NULL, then the kernel chooses the (page-aligned) address  at
which to create the mapping; this is the most portable method of creat‐
ing a new mapping.  

If addr is not NULL, then the kernel takes it as  a
hint about where to place the mapping; on Linux, the kernel will pick a
nearby page boundary (but always above or equal to the value  specified
by /proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr) and attempt to create the mapping there.

If another mapping already exists there, the kernel picks a new address
that may or may not depend on the hint.  The address of the new mapping
is returned as the result of the call.
